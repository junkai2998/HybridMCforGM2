Fast Simulation For Muon G-2 Experiment

About
The simulation is divided into three parts:
1. Beam and spin dynamics of muon in the storage ring
2. Sampling of positrons spectrum (from muon decay) in LAB frame
3. Detection of the positrons


Versions
v0.0.0:
	- first prototype
	- minor mistakes on sampling of positron PZ in the Muon Rest Frame
	- corrected part of the code is in part2 file 
	
v0.0.1:
	- correction to minor mistakes on sampling of positron PZ in MRF (by adding artificial spin precession before lorentz boost)
	- sampling and plotting of the result in the same file (to be separated in the newer version)
	
	
v0.0.2: 
	- separate sampling and plotting codes
	- added a notebook file for quick visualization (using hist_dict.npy that contains only histogram information from a large dataset)
	- added information in the codes
	- the positron sampling codes is still in toyMC status, beam and spin dynamics to be added later


v0.1.0:
	- added modularity to positron sampling code: test_modules.ipynb
	- tested positron sampling (with uniformly distributed random number VS simple beam and spin dynamics), see test_modules.ipynb
	- Changed alpha, rot variables to theta_s (spin angle), theta_c (cyclotron angle)
	- GeneratePositron_LAB: changed beta_mu_x,z to muDecayPX,Z (muDecay vs muInit problem to be resolved later) 
	- removed W_mue from GeneratePositron_MRF(to reduce redundancy) and modified GenerateMichelKinematics to return energy,cos(theta) instead of x,cos(theta)


v0.1.1: *latest*
	- revert GenerateMichelKinematics to x,cos(theta)
	- added muDecayPY return in  GeneratePositron_LAB; muDecayPolY in GeneratePositron_MRF (not considering EDM, set to 0)
	- removed 02_positron_sampling/test_modules.ipynb and added modules in external .py files: Constants.py, FourVector.py, PositronDecay.py
	- upgrade positron sampling (01_sampling.ipynb in version <v0.1.0) in terms of the modules
	- new directory: 01_beam_spin_dyn,incoporated simple beam and spin dynamics (cyclotron motion and spin precession) in simplebd.ipynb
	known issues:
	- EvsPhase diagram not uniform, cant fully matched to gm2ringsim data


v0.1.2: (comming soon)
	- try simple bd data (turn off muon decay)+ ML to produce wiggle plot


(planning)
	- general rotation (3-parameters) implementation
