Fast Simulation For Muon G-2 Experiment

About
The simulation is divided into three parts:
1. Beam and spin dynamics of muon in the storage ring
2. Sampling of positrons spectrum (from muon decay) in LAB frame
3. Detection of the positrons


Versions
v0.0.0:
	- first prototype
	- minor mistakes on sampling of positron PZ in the Muon Rest Frame
	- corrected part of the code is in part2 file 
	
v0.0.1:
	- correction to minor mistakes on sampling of positron PZ in MRF (by adding artificial spin precession before lorentz boost)
	- sampling and plotting of the result in the same file (to be separated in the newer version)
	
	
v0.0.2: *latest*
	- separate sampling and plotting codes
	- added a notebook file for quick visualization (using hist_dict.npy that contains only histogram information from a large dataset)
	- added information in the codes


v0.1.0: (planning)
	- add modularity
	- general rotation (3-parameters) implementation
